  - This is an example.
  - Remember to stay hydrated.
  - Please build your game regularly.
  - A class should only have a single responsibility.
  - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without
    altering the correctness of that program.
  - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
  - One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
  - 'DRY: Don''t Repeat Yourself'
  - Please use a spell checker.
  - Have you commited today?
